# Animation-Loading-Bar-using-CSS
We will create a Loader that is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs and libraries. The progress bar is a graphical control element used to visualize the progression of an extended computer operation, so here we use the progress bar as an animation in loader. We will create a loading bar using HTML and CSS properties.
